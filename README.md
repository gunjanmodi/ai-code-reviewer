# AI Code Review CLI

An intelligent CLI tool that reviews Git patch files using LLMs like GPT-4. It performs **staged analysis** to classify code areas (UI, API, Backend, etc.), run **targeted category-based reviews**, and output concise, structured feedback (including file, line number, and issue summary).

---

## Overview

This tool helps software engineers reduce code review fatigue by automating initial PR feedback. It works in three review stages:

1. **Scope Classification** ‚Äì Categorizes the patch (e.g., UI, Backend, Security).
2. **Targeted Review** ‚Äì Performs checklist-based analysis per category.
3. **Optional Deep Dive** ‚Äì Deeper analysis for Security, Performance, and Edge Cases.

The output is clean JSON containing only actionable improvements with file path, line number, and short descriptions.

## How to Use

### üî∏ Review a Patch File

```bash
python cli.py path/to/your.patch
```

This will:

* Classify the patch context (UI, Backend, etc.)
* Perform focused code review using pre-defined category checklists
* Print a JSON output with issues found

### Sample Output

```json
[
  {
    "file_path": "src/components/Button.tsx",
    "line_number": 42,
    "issue": "Hardcoded color used instead of design token."
  },
  {
    "file_path": "server/routes/user.ts",
    "line_number": 88,
    "issue": "Missing input validation for user creation route."
  }
]
```

## Future Roadmap
* Make the project as web application or chrome extension
* GitHub webhook integration
* Docker container and VS Code plugin
* Support for Anthropic Claude and Code Llama
